## Reflection ##

I have implemented the PID controller using the formulas from the class, taking into account cte, but not speed. I was not sure 
how to take speed into account, given that in the python code speed in m/s was as used as distance under the assumption that we were
were sampling every 1 sec, and thus speed and distance is the same value in that case.

In terms of hyperparameter selection, I have initially done it by manual trial and error. I have initially started
with params seen in class (Kp=0.2, Kd=3.0, Ki=0.004), analysing each one initially in isolation, and then in combination. 
The oscillations generated by the differential controller have made me reduce its value eventually to 0.5. The best result
I have obtained have been with effectively a PD controller (integral param to 0), but I have only been able to drive 
safely until the first curve.

I wanted to use twiddle for hyperparam optimization but I was not sure how to do it, because twiddle actually needs
feedback from the car in order to evolve the params. So it seems I could actually start with the manually configured params,
and implement twiddle to evolve those params on each new CTE sample. That means I would need to maintain twiddle-related
state within the PID class, for each param.
