1/ Conda Environments for different CarND projects

source activate carnd-term1

Intro to Tensorflow
conda create --name=IntroToTensorFlow python=3 anaconda
source activate IntroToTensorFlow
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow


TensorFlowLab
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-TensorFlow-Lab.git
conda env create -f CarND-TensorFlow-Lab/environment.yml
conda install --name CarND-TensorFlow-Lab -c conda-forge tensorflow
source activate CarND-TensorFlow-Lab


2/ Configuring and accessing GPU-enabled AWS EC2 instance

- create ec2 instance
community ami: carnd
g2.2xlarge
no IAM role
security group: ssh and custom tcp rule to port 8888
no key pair

Instance can be started / stopped. After re-start, IP address may change (to take into account when ssh'ing
and connecting to notebook below)

- connect to instance
ssh carnd@ec2-54-155-73-27.eu-west-1.compute.amazonaws.com
pass: XXX

source activate carnd-term1

download project and run notebook, e.g.:	
git clone https://github.com/udacity/CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
cd CarND-Traffic-Sign-Classifier-Project
jupyter nootebook Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb

then, from a local browser, connect to:
http://54.155.73.27:8888/notebooks/Traffic_Sign_Classifier.ipynb

where the IP address is the IP address of the instance
