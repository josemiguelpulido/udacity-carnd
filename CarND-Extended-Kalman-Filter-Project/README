B/ Code structure

- FusionEKP: 
* code to implement entire flow from Lessons 12 & 13 (tracking class) 
* code to initialize measurement covariance matrices in the constructor from lessons ??
- Tools:
* code to implement RMSE calculation from lessons 22 & 23
* code to implement Jacobian to approximate to lineal, from Lessons 18 & 19
- Kalman Filter:
* code to implement update and predict methods from lessons 12 y 13 (kalman filter class)
* code to extended update method from lesson 
* difference between kalman filter for (linear) laser measurements and extended kalman filter to also support (polar) 
radar measurements, in lesson 20
