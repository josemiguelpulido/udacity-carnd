1/ Ipopt installation

The instructions to install it are:

brew tap homebrew/science
brew install ipopt --with-openblas

ipopt has many dependencies, including gcc:

gcc, libevent, open-mpi, ampl-mp, openblas, pkg-config, cmake, scalapack, mumps

To avoid installing gcc from source and compiling it, first install Xcode command line tools:

xcode-select --install

This way, homebew downloads a precompiled version of gcc.


The installation process also mentions this about another dependency, openblas (in case it was necessary):

For compilers to find this software you may need to set:
    LDFLAGS:  -L/usr/local/opt/openblas/lib
    CPPFLAGS: -I/usr/local/opt/openblas/include

Finally, after successul ipopt install, I got:

Warning: homebrew/science/ipopt dependency gcc was built with a different C++ standard
library (libstdc++ from clang). This may cause problems at runtime.
